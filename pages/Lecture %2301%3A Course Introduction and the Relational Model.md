title:: Lecture #01: Course Introduction and the Relational Model

- Databases
	- Organized collection of inter-related data that models some aspect of the real-world.
	- Databases are the core component of most computer applications.
- Database Management System
	- A DBMS is a software that allows applications to store and analyze information in a database.
	- A general-purpose of DBMS is designed to allow definition, creation, querying, updation, administration of databases.
- Relation model
	- Relation model has 3 key points:
		- Store database in simple data structures.
		- Access data through high-level language.
		- Physical storage left up to（留待） implementation.
	- A ***data model*** is a collection of concepts for describing the data in a database.
	- A ***schema*** is a description of a particular collection of data, using a given data model.
	- A *relation* is an unordered set that contains the relationship of attributes that represents entities.
	- A *tuple* is a set of attribute values in the relation.
	- Keys
		- A relation's *primary key* uniquely identifies a single tuple.
		- A *foreign key* specifies that an attribute from one relation has to map to a tuple in another relation.
