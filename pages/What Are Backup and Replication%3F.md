- ## The Main Differences Between Backup and Replication
- ### Definition
- Backup involves making a copy or copies of data at specific points in time.
  Replication is the act of copying and then moving data between a company's sites. It is typically measured in Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO).
- ### Purpose
- Backup focuses on compliance and granular recovery, such as long-term archival of business records.
  Replication and recovery focus on Disaster Recovery-quick and easy resumption of operations after an outage or corruption. Miniminzing the Recovery Time Objective(RTO) is key.
